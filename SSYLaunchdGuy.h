 the user's next login/startup.   Otherwise, you wouldn't

/*!
 @brief    Unloads and removes the plist file, or else unloads and then
 reloads an existing launchd agent,
 in a separate process, so that, if used carefully, this method can
 unload the agent which launched the process that called it.

 @details  If the given label is nil, or if the file in ~/Library/LaunchAgents
 which it indicates does not exist, this method returns YES immediately and
 does not unload, reload  nor remove anything.
 
 This method writes to a temporary file a shell
 script which does the following:
 * Waits for an optional delay
 * Unloads the specified agent from launchd, using launchctl
 * Either removes the specified agent's plist file or sleeps for 1 second and then reloads it
 * Removes the temporary file
 
 If a timeout is given, this method
 then launches another process to wait until the plist file has
 been actually deleted from the filesystem before returning or timing out.
 Otherwise, it returns YES immediately.
 
 Executing the shell script in a separate process is important
 because, in the first step of the script there,
 launchctl will either not return until any running process launched
 by the agent to be unloaded has exitted, or else quit that process,
 or after a timeout whose default value is 25 seconds, and kill the
 process.  Therefore, if you want to remove the agent which started
 the calling process, you need to know T = how much more time your
 process might need before it exits, and thenâ€¦

 *  Make sure that T < 25 seconds
 *  Pass afterDelay: > T
 *  Pass timeout = 0.0
 
 One usage is to work around the fact that launchd does not support
 a "one shot" Agent.  You can invoke this method near the end of the launched
 task, following the above rules, to make your agent "one shot".
 
 The purpose of the justReload option is in case you are superstitious,
 as I am, that launchd sometimes will fail to launch your task repeatedly,
 and that unloading and reloading the task will help.  You can invoke this
 method with justReload = YES whenever you're feeling insecure about launchd.
 I call this operation to "revitalize" the agent.
 
 @param    label  A string which is used to specify the path
 to the plist file.  After appending the file extension "plist"
 to the given label, per the convention stated in man launchd.plist(5)
 "for launchd property list files to be named <Label>.plist",
 the path to the user's Launch Agents, i.e. ~/Library/LaunchAgents/,
 is prepended.  May be nil in which case this method is no-op.  
 @param    delay  Time in seconds which the script will sleep
 before unloading the agent.
 @param    justReload  If YES, will not remove the specified
 agent but will instead unload it, wait 1 second, and then reload
 it.  See "revitalize" in the Details section.
 @param    timeout  If greater than 0.0, this method will block
 until the plist file to be deleted from the filesystem, or up to
 timeout seconds, before returning.  Otherwise, this method will
 return immediately.  Note that if you pass justReload=YES, there
 is a built-in delay of 1 second, so timeout should be more than
 1 second.
 @result   NO if 'timeout' is > 0.0 and the
 agent's plist file is not deleted before the timeout;
 otherwise, YES.
